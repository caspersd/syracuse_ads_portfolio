## Project Overview  
The **Landscaping Quote Management System** was developed to streamline job estimation, invoicing, and payment processing for landscaping businesses. This system ensures businesses can generate accurate and professional quotes while tracking customer information, material costs, service rates, employee wages, and payments.

## Database Implementation  
The database was implemented using **MySQL**, with structured tables storing customer details, quotes, invoices, payments, and service pricing. SQL scripts were used to:  
- Insert and update customer records.  
- Generate invoices automatically from quotes.  
- Process payments only when they match invoice totals.  
- Apply sales tax and discounts dynamically.  

Stored procedures ensure **data integrity** and automate financial transactions efficiently.

## Reporting & Insights  
The system supports reports that provide insights into business operations, such as:  
- Pending quotes and their status.  
- Overdue invoices and accounts receivable.  
- Revenue trends and most requested services.
